        The reindeer is a symbol of a life in harmony with nature. Through millennia reindeer have adapted to the Nordic landscape. The Sami have lived in harmony with the reindeer which, to some extent, have become accustomed to humans, however it still needs to roam freely and graze undisturbed. It requires therefore understanding and respect from us as guests in this the reindeer country. Within the herd the reindeer is safe and you can watch them at a distance. If the herd walks away, it means you are too close. During the calving period April to May the reindeer is particularly sensitive.
        When herds have formed extra care must be taken so that they do not spread and remember reindeer experiencing stray dogs as a threat.
        There is an old promise between Sami and reindeer – that they will take care of each other - for all time.
