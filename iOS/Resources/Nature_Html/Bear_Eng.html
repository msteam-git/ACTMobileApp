    <p class="pText">Bears are omnivorous just like us humans. They eat berries, mainly blueberries, and other plants, insects- mainly ants, fish, mammals like elk or reindeer calves and often carrion. It’s a great experience to meet a bear. But remember, they can be dangerous if they feel threatened. Largest bear caught in Sweden weighed 343 kg.</p>
    <p class="pText"><em>Did You Know?</em><br />Scientists worked out that a bear can eat around 180 000 blueberries per day.</p>
    <p class="pText">That a bear can run up to 65 km/hr. However, no need to panic as the chance of seeing a bear in northern Sweden is extremely rare. Most people live in the area their whole life without having been lucky enough to see a single one.</p>
